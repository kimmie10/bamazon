# bamazon

This project uses node.js, MySql, npm packages and JavaScript to build a storefront named Bamazon. The app takes in orders and removes stock from the mySql database and reports to the customer there total purchase. I attemped to incorporate the NPM package cli-table however my table kept replicating itself everytime an item was purchased. This will be a later upgrade once I work out the bug.

You can see the app in action at this url:  <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HUlno1fDehzBmHWF-XE4wNDToV61DAv1/view?usp=sharing>
